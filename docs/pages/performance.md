# Performance

Nearest neighbors search algorithms and systems are generally evaluated with two metrics: recall and latency.
Ideally you want high recall and low latency.

Elastiknn is a young project and doesn't have a thorough benchmarking suite yet.
Still, this document should provide some useful context and preliminary metrics.

## Preliminary Metrics

Before drawing conclusions from these metrics, please take a moment to understand [Elastiknn's design decisions and tradeoffs](/design). 


## Plans for More Exhaustive Benchmarking
